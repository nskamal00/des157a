            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>My topic for the final project will be to create more user interactions within the page as well as a home page to introduce the topic. I will be updating my Every Picture Project. </p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal is to create a new page before my old project page to introduce the food pictures. My project is similar to Pinterest, I think Pinterest does saving and adding photos to mood board well, so I would like to replicate that. My project
                is similar to Pinterest in its grid layout and ability to open an overlay with more information on the photo. It is different because it has its own branding and logo. It also does not have as much functionality as Pinterest. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col2">
            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>I think the homepage should be more like Pinterest with a white background and logo in the top left corner with a search bar. The image grid container should be expanded to fit more pictures. I will continue to use the same color palette and
                Helvetica font. </p>
            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>My main interactions will be clicking on a photo, “saving” it to a board, and then linking the board to the board, which is my original page. The homepage will have a hover only on the photo that needs to be clicked. I may make the other photos
                black and white to entice the user to click. </p>
            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>I am hoping that the experience that create is similar to the one of Pinterest. Seamless, with little to no distractions is the goal I want to achieve. </p>
