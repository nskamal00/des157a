        <p>In “Best Practices for Form Design”, an article by Salim Ansari, he lays out some tips and tricks on creating user-friendly forms, an essential aspect of UX design. Forms play a crucial role in collecting user information and facilitating website
            interactions, so having an effective form design can greatly impact a users experience. The article dives into how people process information and make decisions. For example, he states that the best position for placing a form label is above
            an input field because users are not forced to look separately at the label and input field; doing this decreases the number of eye fixations. We want to keep the form simple with minimal errors. </p>
        <p>Though the article emphasizes that we should avoid all unnecessary questions and minimize visual noise, there are moments when we should prioritize providing more details. For example, if your form asks for sensitive information, make sure to
            explain, why you need them by providing a support text close to the input field. With no explanation, they are likely to abandon the form. Another case of providing additional information would be when we need to explain any input or formatting
            requirements such as case sensitivity, number of characters, etc. By following the practices outlined in the article, designers can improve the overall experience and ensure that the forms are easy to use.
