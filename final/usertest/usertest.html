        <h2>MY OBSERVATIONS</h2>

        <p>
            1.) Some users had trouble finding which picture to hover over, but once they did, they immediately knew to click the image. <br> 2.) User tried to click search bar, even though it was non-functional.<br> 3.) User scrolled down on overlay
            even though it is supposed to be fixed positioning.
            <br><br> Based on this feedback, I will add the overlay to around 8 photos so the user can hover around and find the correct photos. I want to make a title over the search bar and have it animate like a typewriter so the user does not get
            confused and click a non-functional button. The last thing I need to do is fix the scroll on the overlay.
