        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-02-08"><i>February 8th, 2023</i></time>
        <p>This article presents ten photographs and suggests ways that teachers can use them to help students develop critical thinking skills. This strategy could be good for educators who are interested in incorporating visual media into their curriculum
            and looking for ways to engage students in discussions about meaning and interpretation. It is also a skill that everyone should practice to dig deeper in life. I specifically thought the three open-ended questions were good ways to lead someone
            to an answer without telling them the answer. I thought it was cool how they applied to it to the schools curriculum by switching the subject matter in the question. <br> <br>Overall, it seem like a useful resource for educator who are looking
            for ways to integrate visual media into their curriculum and help students develop analysis skills. It is also fun to pretend to be a detective sometimes.

        <h2>Best Practices for Modal/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-02-07"><i>February 7th, 2023</i></time>
        <p>The article "Best Practices for Modals, Overlays, Dialog Windows" provides guidelines for designing and implementing effective modals, overlays, and dialog windows in user interface design. The author suggests that modals should be used sparingly,
            have clear and concise content, provide appropriate actions, be dismissible, and have good accessibility. <br> <br> This article can serve as a reference for UX designers when they are designing similar elements in the future. By following
            the guidelines outlined in the article, UX designers can create modals, overlays, and dialog windows that are effective, accessible, and user-friendly. I think modals can be good way to grab the user’s attention, but they interrupt the user
            flow.

        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <time datetime="2023-01-30"><i>January 30th, 2023</i></time>
        <p>In “Best Practices for Form Design”, an article by Salim Ansari, he lays out some tips and tricks on creating user-friendly forms, an essential aspect of UX design. Forms play a crucial role in collecting user information and facilitating website
            interactions, so having an effective form design can greatly impact a users experience. The article dives into how people process information and make decisions. For example, he states that the best position for placing a form label is above
            an input field because users are not forced to look separately at the label and input field; doing this decreases the number of eye fixations. We want to keep the form simple with minimal errors. <br> <br>Though the article emphasizes that
            we should avoid all unnecessary questions and minimize visual noise, there are moments when we should prioritize providing more details. For example, if your form asks for sensitive information, make sure to explain, why you need them by providing
            a support text close to the input field. With no explanation, they are likely to abandon the form. Another case of providing additional information would be when we need to explain any input or formatting requirements such as case sensitivity,
            number of characters, etc. By following the practices outlined in the article, designers can improve the overall experience and ensure that the forms are easy to use.
