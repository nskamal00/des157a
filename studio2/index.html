            <h2>PARAM PURI AND CHAYA</h2>
            <p>
                Param Puri is a popular snack from Kerala, India, made with ripe bananas and flour. It is also known as Pazham pori. To prepare, bananas are sliced lengthwise and coated in a batter made with flour and water. The banana slices are then deep-fried in hot
                oil until they become crispy and golden-brown. This snack is usually served hot and is a snack commonly sold by street vendors in Kerala. This dish is personal to me because my family prepares it with chaya or ‚Äúchai‚Äù, and makes a great
                snack for gossiping. <br> <br>

            <h2>ONAM SADYA</h2>
            <p>
                Sadya is a grand feast prepared and served during the festival of Onam in Kerala, India. It is the traditional way of celebrating the harvest season and welcoming King Mahabali, an ancient mythical king believed to return to the land during Onam. The
                Onam Sadya usually consists of around 25-30 different types of dishes served on a banana leaf. It includes rice, sambar, rasam, avial, thoran, pulissery, pachadi, payasam, and more. This dish is personal to me because I grew up eating
                Sadya either at my aunts house or at the temple in my hometown.

            <h2>MUTTON BIRYANI</h2>
            <p>
                Biryani is a popular rice dish made by cooking rice with various spices, meat (chicken, lamb, goat, or beef), and sometimes vegetables in a traditional pot called a handi. In Kerala, biryani is an important part of the local cuisine and is widely consumed
                during special occasions and festivals. Kerala-style biryani has its unique taste and flavor, owing to its use of locally available spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and star anise. Biryani is personal to me because it brings my
                family together and is a must-have on special occasions.

            <h2>DAHI PURI</h2>
            <p>
                Dahi puri is a popular Indian street food snack that consists of small, crispy puris filled with a savory mixture of potatoes, onions, and chickpeas, topped with sweet and tangy tamarind chutney yogurt, and sev (crispy noodles made from gram flour). This
                snack is personal to me because my friends father makes it whenever I come into to town. Though this snack is not Kerala-specific, I enjoy food from all parts of India.

            <p>
                Tandoori chicken is a popular Indian dish that consists of marinated chicken cooked in a traditional tandoor oven. The marinade typically includes yogurt, spices, and herbs. The dish is known for its vibrant red color, which comes from the use of turmeric
                and chili powder. Tandoor chicken is comely served at weddings, parties, and other celebratory occasions. It is personal to me because it is one of my favorite takeout orders from Indian restaurants.
